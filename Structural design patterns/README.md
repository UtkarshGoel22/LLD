# Stuctural Design Pattern

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

There are two recurring themes in these patterns:

- This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class libraries work together.
- Structural Design Patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.

Types of Structural Design Patterns:

- Adapter Method Design Patterns
- Bridge Method Design Patterns
- Composite Method Design Patterns
- Decorator Method Design Patterns
- Facade Method Design Patterns
- Flyweight Method Design Patterns
- Proxy Method Design Patterns
