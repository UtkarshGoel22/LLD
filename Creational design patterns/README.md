# Creational Design Pattern

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class thatâ€™s instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

There are two recurring themes in these patterns:

- They all encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system uses.
- They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.

Types of Creational Design Patterns:

- Factory Method Design Pattern
- Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern
- Singleton Method Design Pattern
- Prototype Method Design Pattern
- Builder Method Design Pattern
